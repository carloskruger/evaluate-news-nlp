# Project Evaluate News Project through NLP 

This app takes an article's url, checks to see whether the url is valid and then sends the information to the Aylein API, which analyses the article and evaluates polarity, subjectivity, and displays the results. 

It uses Webpack and Sass as well as Jest for testing.
